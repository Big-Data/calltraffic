This visualization depicts calling patterns by region from the United States to International locations in 2011. To interact with the visualization, click on a region bubble in either the minutes, messages or revenues area. The counties within the selected region will appear below, along with a rotated globe. Clicking on the country bubbles will display futher information on the mouse-over. The size of each bubble is proportional to the other bubbles in the given category (minutes, messages, revenue). Data are from the FCC Annual [International Telecommunications Traffic Reports][ibpage]. For further details on this visualization see the [github repository][git].
